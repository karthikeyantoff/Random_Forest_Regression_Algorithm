RandomForest_Regression
🏠 House Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression

A Machine Learning web application that predicts house prices based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house age, and location-related factors.
The model is built using Random Forest Regression and deployed using Streamlit.

📌 About the Project

This project uses a Random Forest Regression model trained on a realistic housing dataset to estimate house prices.

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate and stable predictions compared to a single model.

The Streamlit application provides a simple and interactive interface where users can input property details and instantly receive a predicted house price.

The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

🤖 Model Details

Algorithm: Random Forest Regression

Library Used: Scikit-Learn

Learning Type: Supervised Learning

Problem Type: Regression

🧠 How the Model Works

Random Forest Regression works by:

Creating multiple decision trees using random subsets of data

Making predictions from each tree

Averaging the predictions to produce a final output

This approach reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy.

🔢 Input Features (Example)

The model takes the following property-related inputs:

Area (sqft)

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms

Number of Floors

Age of House

Distance to City Center

Parking Availability

📤 Output

House Price Prediction

Estimated market price of the house based on the given inputs

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a realistic housing dataset containing synthetic but practical housing features.

It is designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes.
